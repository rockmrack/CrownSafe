## üí° Common Questions & Answers

### "Which technology should we use?"

**React Native** (Recommended):
- ‚úÖ Large community, mature ecosystem
- ‚úÖ TypeScript support excellent
- ‚úÖ Can share code with web (future)
- ‚ùå Slightly larger app size

**Expo**:
- ‚úÖ Fastest development
- ‚úÖ Easy OTA updates
- ‚úÖ Great developer experience
- ‚ùå Some limitations for native modules

**Flutter**:
- ‚úÖ Excellent performance
- ‚úÖ Beautiful UI out of box
- ‚ùå Dart language (not TypeScript)
- ‚ùå Smaller community

**Recommendation**: Start with **React Native** or **Expo**

---

### "Do we need all these CI/CD workflows?"

**Short answer**: Not immediately, but they're gold later.

**Phase 1** (MVP):
- Use: Basic linting and tests
- Skip: Automated deployments (manual is fine)

**Phase 2** (Production):
- Use: Full CI/CD pipeline
- Benefit: Catch bugs early, faster releases

---

### "How do I test the API?"

1. **Give developer staging credentials**:
   ```
   API_BASE_URL=https://babyshield.cureviax.ai
   TEST_EMAIL=test@babyshield.dev
   TEST_PASSWORD=[Provide secure password]
   ```

2. **Create test account** for them
3. **Share Postman collection** (if you have one)
4. **Point to API docs**: `MOBILE_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

---

### "What's the timeline?"

**Typical mobile app timeline**:

| Phase         | Duration      | Deliverable                     |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Setup         | 3 days        | Project initialized, first PR   |
| Core features | 2 weeks       | Auth, navigation, basic screens |
| Integration   | 2 weeks       | All API endpoints working       |
| Polish        | 1 week        | UI refinement, error handling   |
| Testing       | 1 week        | Bug fixes, testing              |
| **Total**     | **6-7 weeks** | **MVP ready for beta**          |

Adjust based on:
- Developer experience
- Feature complexity
- Design requirements
- Your feedback speed
