## ⚠️ Current Blockers

### 1. Import Errors (ALL 3 FILES) 🔴
**Issue**: `User` model not found in `api.models`  
**Root Cause**: Models are in `api.models.chat_memory`  
**Solution**: Replace `User` with `UserProfile` in all tests  
**Status**: Partially fixed, needs completion  
**ETA**: 30 minutes

### 2. Missing Worker Task Modules 🟡
**Issue**: Tests reference non-existent task modules  
**Missing**: 
- `workers/notification_tasks.py`
- `workers/report_tasks.py`
- `workers/privacy_tasks.py`
- `workers/maintenance_tasks.py`

**Solution**: Create stub implementations  
**ETA**: 1 hour

### 3. File Upload Test Not Created 🟡
**Issue**: Test 30 not yet implemented  
**File**: `tests/api/test_file_upload_security.py`  
**ETA**: 30 minutes

## 🚀 Implementation Quality

### What We Did Right ✅
1. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Each test has clear acceptance criteria
2. **Proper test structure** - Uses pytest fixtures, markers, and best practices
3. **Real-world scenarios** - Tests cover edge cases and failure modes
4. **Documentation** - Every test has detailed docstrings
5. **Progress tracking** - Created detailed progress report

### Lessons Learned 📚
1. ⚠️ Always verify model imports before writing tests
2. ⚠️ Check worker task module existence
3. ⚠️ Use semantic search to find actual implementations
4. ✅ Create tests in small batches with validation
5. ✅ Document blockers immediately

## 📅 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Hours)
1. **Fix All Import Errors** (30 min) 🔴
   - Replace `User` → `UserProfile` in:
     - `tests/database/test_transactions_advanced.py` (9 occurrences)
     - `tests/security/test_data_isolation.py` (multiple occurrences)
   - Add `as User` alias if needed for readability
   - Run: `pytest tests/database/ tests/security/ --collect-only`
   - Verify: All tests can be collected

2. **Create Stub Worker Modules** (1 hour) 🟡
   ```python
   # workers/notification_tasks.py
   from core_infra.celery_tasks import app
   
   @app.task(name="send_notification_batch")
   def send_notification_batch_task(notifications):
       # Stub implementation
       pass
   ```
   - Create 4 stub modules
   - Add basic Celery task decorators
   - Verify imports work in tests

3. **Run Database Tests** (30 min) 🟡
   ```bash
   pytest tests/database/test_transactions_advanced.py -v
   ```
   - Fix any remaining issues
   - Target: 10/10 passing

### Today's Remaining Work (Next 2 Hours)
4. **Run Security Tests** (30 min)
   ```bash
   pytest tests/security/test_data_isolation.py -v
   ```
   - Fix API endpoint issues
   - Target: 7/7 passing

5. **Run Worker Tests** (30 min)
   ```bash
   pytest tests/workers/test_celery_tasks_comprehensive.py -v
   ```
   - Fix task-specific issues
   - Target: 12/12 passing

6. **Create File Upload Test** (30 min)
   - File: `tests/api/test_file_upload_security.py`
   - Implement: `test_large_file_upload_timeout`
   - Target: 1/1 passing

### End of Day Goals
