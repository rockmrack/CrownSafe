- [ ] Wait for CI checks (GREEN)
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Squash and merge to main

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify production deployment
- [ ] Check health endpoints
- [ ] Monitor logs
- [ ] Verify API endpoints

## üìù Known Issues/Warnings

### Non-Blocking Warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  PyZbar library not available (using fallback) - EXPECTED
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  DataMatrix scanning optional - EXPECTED
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Redis connection warning during startup - RESOLVES AFTER STARTUP

### Optional Features

## ‚úÖ Ready for Production

**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY**

All critical systems are operational, all tests passing, and the Docker stack is healthy. The application is ready for production deployment via Pull Request.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Create PR from current state
2. ‚è≥ Wait for CI checks
3. ‚è≥ Review and merge
4. ‚è≥ Deploy to production
5. ‚è≥ Verify production health
