            Has anyone else had issues with the new batch of <strong>Happy Baby Super-Puffs</strong>? My son started getting a strange rash after eating them. I'm worried they might have changed the formula. It's a real shame, he loves them!

            @MomOfTwo That's concerning! We haven't had a problem, but I did notice the packaging was different. Maybe it's a bad batch? Definitely a safety issue if so.

            I heard a rumor that some of the puffs have a choking hazard. Be careful! This is a major safety concern.
