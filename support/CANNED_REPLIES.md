## üîç Search & Recall Issues

### No Search Results Found
```
Subject: Re: No search results - Ticket #[NUMBER]

Hi [Name],

Thank you for reaching out about the search issue. I understand you're not getting results when searching for [PRODUCT].

Let me help you troubleshoot:

1. **Check spelling** - Try alternate spellings or partial product names
2. **Use broad terms** - Search for brand name only (e.g., "Graco" instead of full model)
3. **Remove special characters** - Avoid symbols like &, -, or /
4. **Try barcode scanning** - Use the camera icon to scan the product directly

If you're still not finding results, this could mean:
- The product hasn't been recalled
- It's listed under a different name
- It's a new product not yet in our database

Would you mind sharing:
- The exact product name and model?
- A photo of the product label?

This helps us improve our search accuracy for everyone.

Best regards,
[Agent Name]

### Barcode Scanning Not Working
```
Subject: Re: Barcode scanner issue - Ticket #[NUMBER]

Hi [Name],

I understand the barcode scanner isn't working properly. Let's troubleshoot this together:

**Camera Permissions:**
iOS: Settings ‚Üí BabyShield ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Allow
Android: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí BabyShield ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Camera

**Scanning Tips:**
1. **Lighting** - Ensure good lighting (avoid glare)
2. **Distance** - Hold phone 6-8 inches from barcode
3. **Steady** - Keep phone still for 2-3 seconds
4. **Clean** - Wipe camera lens and barcode
5. **Angle** - Try different angles if reflecting

**Alternative Options:**
- Type the UPC number manually (usually 12 digits under barcode)
- Search by product name and brand
- Take a photo and email it to us

**Still not working?**
There might be an issue with:
- Camera hardware
- Damaged/non-standard barcode
- Regional barcode format

Please let me know:
- Can other apps scan barcodes?
- What type of product? (food, toy, car seat, etc.)
- Country where product was purchased?

We'll get this sorted out!
