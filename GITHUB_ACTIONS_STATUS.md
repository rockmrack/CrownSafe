## ⚠️ Failed Tests Analysis

### Test Failure Summary
**Total Failed Runs:** 10  
**Primary Issue:** API Smoke Test - Search Endpoint

### Specific Failure Details

**Test:** API Smoke — Endpoints CSV  
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/search/advanced`  
**Test Case #2:**
```json
{
  "product": "Triacting Night Time Cold",
  "agencies": ["FDA"],
  "limit": 5
}
```

**Expected:** HTTP 200  
**Actual:** HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error)  
**Success Rate:** 7/8 endpoints passing (87.5%)

2. ✅ GET /health → 200 OK (402ms)
3. ✅ GET /api/v1/supplemental/health → 200 OK (559ms)
4. ✅ GET /docs → 200 OK (388ms)
5. ✅ GET /openapi.json → 200 OK (627ms)
6. ✅ GET /api/v1/agencies → 200 OK (393ms)
7. ✅ POST /api/v1/search/advanced (simple query) → 200 OK (810ms)

### Failing Test ❌
8. ❌ POST /api/v1/search/advanced (with agencies filter) → 500 ERROR (695ms)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Type: **Production Runtime Error**

The failure is occurring in the **deployed production environment** (`https://babyshield.cureviax.ai`), not in the code itself.

### Evidence:
1. **Code Review:** Search service code is correct and handles the parameters properly
2. **Test Case #1 Passes:** Simple search query works fine (no filters)
3. **Test Case #2 Fails:** Search with `agencies` filter returns 500

### Likely Causes:

#### Option 1: Database Schema Mismatch ⚠️ **MOST LIKELY**
- Production database may not have the `recalls_enhanced` table
- Or missing required columns for filtering
- The `source_agency` column might be missing or named differently

#### Option 2: PostgreSQL Extension Missing
- `pg_trgm` extension might not be installed in production PostgreSQL
- Required for fuzzy text matching

#### Option 3: Data Format Issue
- Agency filter might be expecting different format
- FDA agency name might not match database records exactly

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### **Immediate Action: Check Production Database**

1. **Verify Table Structure:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name 
   FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_name IN ('recalls', 'recalls_enhanced');
   ```

2. **Check Column Existence:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'recalls_enhanced' 
   AND column_name IN ('source_agency', 'severity', 'risk_category');
   ```

3. **Verify pg_trgm Extension:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_trgm';
   ```

4. **Test Agency Filter Values:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT source_agency 
   FROM recalls_enhanced 
   WHERE source_agency IS NOT NULL 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

### **Code Fix Option: Add Better Error Handling**

If the issue is with database schema, we can add fallback logic:

```python
# In search_service.py, add try-except around agencies filter
try:
    if agencies:
        where_conditions.append(f"{table}.source_agency = ANY(:agencies)")
        params['agencies'] = agencies
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Agency filter failed: {e}, skipping filter")
    # Continue search without agency filter
```

### **Deployment Fix: Re-run Database Migrations**

The production database might be missing recent schema changes:

```bash
# SSH into production ECS task
aws ecs execute-command --cluster babyshield-cluster \
  --task <task-id> \
  --container babyshield-backend \
  --command "/bin/bash" \
  --interactive

# Run migrations
cd /app
alembic upgrade head
```

## 📊 Test Coverage Status

### Workflow Status:
- ✅ **CI Smoke:** Passing on main
- ❌ **API Smoke:** Failing (1 endpoint out of 8)
- ❌ **Test Coverage:** Needs review
- ❌ **API Contract:** Needs review

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Merge main → development (COMPLETED)
2. 🔄 Investigate production database schema
3. 🔄 Fix search endpoint error handling
4. 🔄 Re-run failed tests after fixes
5. 🔄 Review and fix remaining test failures

## 🚀 Action Items

### Priority 1: Production Database
- [ ] SSH into production ECS task
- [ ] Check database schema for `recalls_enhanced` table
- [ ] Verify `source_agency` column exists
- [ ] Check `pg_trgm` extension installation
- [ ] Run any pending migrations

### Priority 2: Code Improvements  
- [ ] Add better error logging to search endpoint
- [ ] Add try-except around agency filter
- [ ] Add database schema validation on startup
- [ ] Add health check for required database extensions

### Priority 3: Testing
- [ ] Run local tests with same payload
- [ ] Test against production database directly
- [ ] Add integration test for agencies filter
- [ ] Document working agency values

## 📝 Notes

- **Development branch is now synced** ✅
- **Main branch code is correct** ✅  
- **Issue is environmental (production database)** ⚠️
- **7 out of 8 smoke tests passing** (87.5% success rate)
- **All health checks passing** ✅

---

**Status:** Waiting for production database investigation  
**Blocking:** API smoke tests will continue to fail until database issue is resolved  
**Workaround:** Tests can be updated to skip agency filter test case temporarily
