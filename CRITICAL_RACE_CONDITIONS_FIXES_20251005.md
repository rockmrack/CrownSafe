## 🔴 CRITICAL #1: Background Task Session Bug

### The Problem
**File:** `api/incident_report_endpoints.py` line 479-487  
**Impact:** `DetachedInstanceError` → 500 errors in production

**What Was Wrong:**
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
db.add(incident)
db.flush()  # Get the ID

# Analyze incident in background
background_tasks.add_task(
    IncidentAnalyzer.analyze_incident,
    incident,  # ❌ SQLAlchemy object passed by reference
    db         # ❌ Session will be closed before task runs
)

db.commit()  # ⚠️ Session closes HERE
# Background task runs AFTER response is sent
# incident object is now DETACHED from session
# Any attribute access → DetachedInstanceError → 500
```

**Root Cause:**
1. FastAPI background tasks run AFTER the response is sent
2. Database session is closed when response completes
3. SQLAlchemy objects become "detached" when session closes
4. Background task tries to access detached object → crash

### The Fix

**Changes:**
```python
# AFTER (SAFE)
db.add(incident)
db.flush()  # Get the ID

# ✅ Extract ID before session closes
incident_id = incident.id

db.commit()  # Session closes here safely

# ✅ Pass ID only, not the object
background_tasks.add_task(
    analyze_incident_background,  # New wrapper function
    incident_id
)

# New background task wrapper
def analyze_incident_background(incident_id: int):
    """
    Creates its own database session to avoid DetachedInstanceError
    """
    from core_infra.database import SessionLocal
    import asyncio
    
    db = SessionLocal()  # ✅ Fresh session for background task
    try:
        # Fetch incident by ID in new session
        incident = db.query(IncidentReport).filter(
            IncidentReport.id == incident_id
        ).first()
        
        if not incident:
            logger.warning(f"Incident {incident_id} not found")
            return
        
        # Run async analysis with fresh session
        asyncio.run(IncidentAnalyzer.analyze_incident(incident, db))
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Background analysis failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
        db.rollback()
    finally:
        db.close()  # ✅ Clean up session
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Pass primitive data (ID) instead of ORM objects
- ✅ Background task creates its own session
- ✅ No detached objects, no 500 errors
- ✅ Proper error handling and cleanup

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates all `DetachedInstanceError` crashes
- ✅ Incident analysis runs reliably in background
- ✅ No more 500 errors from background tasks

## 🔴 CRITICAL #2: Race Condition in User Seeding

### The Problem
**File:** `api/main_babyshield.py` lines 1552-1561  
**Impact:** `IntegrityError` crashes all workers on startup

**What Was Wrong:**
```python
# BEFORE (RACE CONDITION)
db = SessionLocal()
try:
    # ❌ Check-then-insert pattern
    if not db.query(User).filter(User.id == 1).first():  # Check
        u = User(id=1, email="test@example.com", ...)
        db.add(u)
        db.commit()  # Insert

# Timeline with 3 workers starting simultaneously:
# T1: Worker A checks → user doesn't exist → passes check
# T2: Worker B checks → user doesn't exist → passes check
# T3: Worker C checks → user doesn't exist → passes check
# T4: Worker A inserts → SUCCESS
# T5: Worker B inserts → IntegrityError (duplicate key) → CRASH
# T6: Worker C inserts → IntegrityError (duplicate key) → CRASH
```

**Root Cause:**
1. Check and insert are separate operations (not atomic)
2. Multiple workers can pass the check simultaneously
3. First worker succeeds, others crash on `IntegrityError`
4. Classic Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition

### The Fix

**Changes:**
```python
# AFTER (RACE-CONDITION SAFE)
from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError as UserIntegrityError

db = SessionLocal()
try:
    # ✅ Try-insert-catch pattern (optimistic locking)
    try:
        u = User(id=1, email="test@example.com", ...)
        db.add(u)
        db.commit()  # Try to insert
        logger.info("✅ Seeded default user")
        
    except UserIntegrityError:
        # ✅ Another worker inserted first - that's fine!
        db.rollback()
        logger.info("👤 User already exists (inserted by another worker)")
        
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Failed to seed user: {e}", exc_info=True)
    db.rollback()
finally:
    db.close()

# Timeline with 3 workers now:
# T1: Worker A tries insert → SUCCESS
# T2: Worker B tries insert → IntegrityError → catch & continue
# T3: Worker C tries insert → IntegrityError → catch & continue
# ✅ All workers start successfully!
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ No separate check - just try to insert
- ✅ Database uniqueness constraint prevents duplicates
- ✅ `IntegrityError` is expected and handled gracefully
- ✅ All workers start successfully

**Impact:**
- ✅ No more startup crashes
- ✅ Safe concurrent worker initialization
- ✅ Production-ready multi-worker deployment

## 🔴 CRITICAL #3: Event Loop Deadlock

### The Problem
**File:** `api/recall_alert_system.py` lines 460, 479, 487  
**Impact:** Worker hangs, memory leaks, deadlocks

**What Was Wrong:**
```python
# BEFORE (DEADLOCK RISK)
def check_all_agencies_for_recalls():  # ❌ Regular function
    """Celery task"""
    
    with get_db() as db:
        for agency in agencies:
            # ❌ Creates NEW event loop each time!
            result = asyncio.run(
                RecallAlertService.check_agency_for_new_recalls(...)
            )
            
            for recall in result.recalls:
                # ❌ Another NEW event loop!
                affected_users = asyncio.run(
                    RecallAlertService.find_affected_users(...)
                )
                
                for user_id in affected_users:
                    # ❌ Yet another NEW event loop!
                    asyncio.run(
                        RecallAlertService.send_recall_alert(...)
                    )
```

**Root Cause:**
1. `asyncio.run()` creates a NEW event loop each time
2. If Celery already has an event loop running → `RuntimeError`
3. Even if it works, creates multiple event loops → memory leaks
4. Event loops not properly closed → resources exhausted
5. Can cause entire worker to hang

**Event Loop Conflicts:**
```
Main Process Event Loop
└── Celery Worker Event Loop
    └── asyncio.run() creates THIRD loop  ← CONFLICT!
        └── asyncio.run() creates FOURTH loop  ← MORE CONFLICT!
            └── ... (memory leak spiral)
```

### The Fix

**Changes:**
```python
# AFTER (NO DEADLOCK)
async def check_all_agencies_for_recalls():  # ✅ Async function
    """
    Async Celery task that checks all agencies for new recalls
    
    NOTE: Converted to async to avoid event loop conflicts
    """
    from core_infra.database import SessionLocal
    
    db = SessionLocal()  # ✅ Explicit session management
    
    try:
        for agency in agencies:
            # ✅ Use SAME event loop - no new loop created
            result = await RecallAlertService.check_agency_for_new_recalls(...)
            
            for recall in result.recalls:
                # ✅ Still in SAME event loop
                affected_users = await RecallAlertService.find_affected_users(...)
                
                for user_id in affected_users:
                    # ✅ All using ONE event loop
                    await RecallAlertService.send_recall_alert(...)
                    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error: {e}", exc_info=True)
    finally:
        db.close()  # ✅ Clean up session
```

**Event Loop Now:**
```
Main Process Event Loop
└── Celery Worker Event Loop (if present)
    └── Same event loop reused for all awaits  ← SAFE!
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ One function = one event loop (reused)
- ✅ All `await` calls use the same event loop
- ✅ No conflicts, no deadlocks
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup

**Additional Improvements:**
- ✅ Changed from context manager to explicit `SessionLocal()` for clarity
- ✅ Added `exc_info=True` to error logging for debugging
- ✅ Added docstring explaining async conversion

**Impact:**
- ✅ No more worker hangs
- ✅ No event loop conflicts
- ✅ No memory leaks from unclosed loops
- ✅ Reliable background recall checking

## 📋 PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE

### PR Title
```
fix: Resolve 3 critical race conditions and event loop deadlocks
```

### PR Description
```markdown
## Problem
Comprehensive system reaudit revealed 3 critical production bugs:

1. **Background Task Session Bug** (DetachedInstanceError)
   - SQLAlchemy objects passed to background tasks after session closed
   - Causes 500 errors when tasks try to access object attributes
   
2. **Race Condition in User Seeding** (IntegrityError)
   - Check-then-insert pattern allows concurrent duplicate inserts
   - Crashes workers on startup in multi-worker environments
   
3. **Event Loop Deadlock** (RuntimeError)
   - Multiple asyncio.run() calls create conflicting event loops
   - Causes worker hangs, memory leaks, and deadlocks

## Solution

### Bug #1: Background Tasks
- Pass primitive IDs instead of ORM objects
- Create new database session in background task
- Proper error handling and session cleanup

### Bug #2: User Seeding
- Try-insert-catch pattern instead of check-then-insert
- Handle IntegrityError gracefully
- Safe concurrent initialization

### Bug #3: Event Loop
- Convert function to async def
- Replace all asyncio.run() with await
- Use single event loop for all operations

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminates all DetachedInstanceError crashes
- ✅ Safe multi-worker deployment
- ✅ No more event loop conflicts

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Background Tasks Need Own Sessions
**Never** pass ORM objects to background tasks.  
**Always** pass IDs and create new sessions.

### 2. Race Conditions in Startup Code
Check-then-insert patterns are dangerous in multi-worker environments.  
Use try-insert-catch or database-level UPSERT operations.

### 3. Event Loop Management
Never use `asyncio.run()` inside async contexts.  
Convert functions to async and use `await` consistently.

### 4. Error Logging
Always use `exc_info=True` for proper stack traces.  
Makes debugging production issues much easier.
