## üèóÔ∏è MULTI-LAYERED DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE

### Layer 1: Network Perimeter (AWS Infrastructure)
### Layer 2: Application Gateway (WAF + Rate Limiting)  
### Layer 3: Application Security (Enhanced Middleware)
### Layer 4: Runtime Protection (Behavioral Analysis)
### Layer 5: Data Protection (Encryption + Isolation)
### Layer 6: Monitoring & Response (AI-Powered Detection)

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE HARDENING (30 minutes)
### PHASE 2: ADVANCED PROTECTION (2 hours)  
### PHASE 3: ENTERPRISE FEATURES (1 day)
### PHASE 4: AI-POWERED DEFENSE (2 days)

## üìã DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### üî• PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE HARDENING (30 min)

#### 1.1 Enhanced Request Filtering
- Block suspicious User-Agents (scanners, bots)
- Rate limiting per IP (100 req/min)
- Geographic blocking (allow only target countries)
- Request size limits (prevent DoS)

#### 1.2 Advanced Path Protection  
- Expand blocked paths list (500+ common attack vectors)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Regex-based pattern detection
- Honeypot endpoints (trap attackers)

#### 1.3 Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options (prevent clickjacking)
- X-Content-Type-Options (prevent MIME sniffing)

### ‚ö° PHASE 2: ADVANCED PROTECTION (2 hours)

#### 2.1 AWS WAF Integration
- Custom rule sets for baby product APIs
- IP reputation filtering
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS attack blocking
- DDoS protection

#### 2.2 Behavioral Analysis
- Request pattern anomaly detection
- Velocity-based blocking
- Fingerprinting suspicious clients
- Adaptive rate limiting

#### 2.3 API Security Hardening
- JWT token validation enhancement
- API key rotation system
- Request signing (HMAC)
- Endpoint-specific rate limits

### üß† PHASE 3: ENTERPRISE FEATURES (1 day)

#### 3.1 Zero-Trust Architecture
- Service mesh with mTLS
- Internal service authentication
- Microservice isolation
- Network segmentation

#### 3.2 Advanced Monitoring
- Real-time threat intelligence

- Automated incident response
- Threat hunting capabilities

#### 3.3 Data Protection
- Field-level encryption
- Database activity monitoring
- Backup encryption
- Secure key management (HSM)

### ü§ñ PHASE 4: AI-POWERED DEFENSE (2 days)

#### 4.1 Machine Learning Security
- Behavioral baseline learning
- Anomaly detection algorithms
- Predictive threat modeling
- Automated response systems

#### 4.2 Advanced Threat Detection
