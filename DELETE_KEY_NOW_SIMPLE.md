## üéØ EXACTLY WHAT TO DO (5 MINUTES)

### Step 1: Open Your Browser

The page should already be open. If not:
- Click this in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  Start-Process 'https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=babyshield-8f552'
  ```

### Step 2: Sign In (if needed)

- Use your Google account that has access to BabyShield

### Step 3: Find the Service Account

Look for this in the list:
```
firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc
```

### Step 4: Click on it

Just click anywhere on that row.

### Step 5: Click "KEYS" tab

At the top, you'll see tabs. Click **KEYS**.

### Step 6: Find the Key

Look for a key with ID starting with:
```
f9d6fbee...
```

### Step 7: Delete It

1. Click the **three dots** (‚ãÆ) on the right
2. Click **"Delete"**
3. Click **"Delete"** again to confirm

### Step 8: Done!

The key is now deleted and cannot be used anymore.

## ‚ùì WHAT IF...

### "I don't see the service account"
- Make sure you're in project `babyshield-8f552`
- Check the project selector at the top
- You may not have access - contact your admin

### "The key is already gone"
- Good news! Someone already deleted it
- You're done! ‚úÖ

### "I can't delete it - no permission"
- You need to be a project admin
- Contact whoever manages your Google Cloud account

## ‚úÖ AFTER YOU DELETE IT

Come back to PowerShell and tell me:
- "Done" or "Deleted" or "Key removed"

Then I'll help you with the next steps:
1. Creating a new service account
2. Updating production
3. Auditing logs
