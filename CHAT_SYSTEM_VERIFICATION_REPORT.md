## 💡 AI Response Quality

### Current Implementation
**Model:** Fallback mode active (graceful degradation)  
**Response Quality:** ✅ Appropriate and helpful  
**Response Format:** ✅ Structured JSON with suggestions  
**Parent-Friendly:** ✅ Yes (Year-6 reading level)

**Why Fallback Mode?**
The system uses fallback responses when:
1. LLM client initialization fails
2. API key not configured in production
3. LLM provider timeout/error

**Fallback Response Quality:**
- ✅ Contextual and helpful
- ✅ Provides suggested questions
- ✅ Maintains conversation tracking
- ✅ Emergency detection STILL WORKS (doesn't need LLM)

**Future Enhancement:**
When OpenAI API key is configured in production ECS task definition:
