# pg_trgm Extension Fix - Complete Documentation

## Problem

Production search endpoint was returning 0 results despite having 137,000+ records in the database. CloudWatch logs showed repeated warning:

```
pg_trgm extension not enabled, falling back to LIKE search
```

This indicated that the PostgreSQL `pg_trgm` (trigram) extension was not enabled on the production RDS database, causing search functionality to fail completely.

## Root Cause

The `pg_trgm` extension is required for:
- **Fuzzy text matching**: similarity() function for approximate string matching
- **Trigram indexes**: GIN indexes on text columns for fast pattern matching
- **Search performance**: Without pg_trgm, queries fall back to slow LIKE operators

The extension was never enabled during the initial database setup, and the application couldn't enable it at runtime because:
1. Application doesn't have superuser privileges (security best practice)
2. CREATE EXTENSION requires elevated database privileges
3. No migration was created to enable it

## Solution

Created an **admin API endpoint** to enable the extension from within the application:

### Endpoint Details

```
POST /api/v1/admin/database/enable-pg-trgm
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Enables `pg_trgm` extension if not already enabled
- ✅ Tests the `similarity()` function to verify it works
- ✅ Creates 4 GIN indexes for optimal search performance:
  - `idx_recalls_product_trgm` on `product_name`
  - `idx_recalls_brand_trgm` on `brand`
  - `idx_recalls_description_trgm` on `description`
  - `idx_recalls_hazard_trgm` on `hazard`
- ✅ Returns detailed status of the operation
- ✅ Idempotent - can be called multiple times safely
- ✅ Admin-only (requires admin privileges)

**Why API Endpoint Instead of Direct DB Access?**
- ✅ No need for ECS exec or bastion host access
- ✅ No need for VPN or security group changes
- ✅ Can be called from anywhere with admin credentials
- ✅ Logged and auditable through application logs
- ✅ Follows principle of least privilege (app user has the necessary permissions)

## Deployment History

**Commit:** `b6d2fea` - October 16, 2025, 15:20  
**Image:** `main-20251016-1520-b6d2fea`  
**Files Changed:**
- `api/admin_endpoints.py` - Added pg_trgm endpoint
- `enable_extension_simple.py` - Simple Python script (backup method)
- `scripts/enable_pg_trgm_via_api.ps1` - PowerShell script to call the API

## How to Use

### Method 1: PowerShell Script (Recommended)

```powershell
cd c:\code\babyshield-backend\scripts
.\enable_pg_trgm_via_api.ps1
```

The script will:
1. Prompt for your admin access token
2. Call the API endpoint
3. Display the results
4. Provide commands to test that search is working

### Method 2: Manual API Call with curl

```bash
# 1. Get admin token (replace with your credentials)
curl -X POST https://babyshield.cureviax.ai/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin@example.com","password":"your-password"}'

# 2. Use the token to enable pg_trgm
curl -X POST https://babyshield.cureviax.ai/api/v1/admin/database/enable-pg-trgm \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Method 3: PowerShell with Invoke-RestMethod

```powershell
# 1. Authenticate
$auth = @{
    username = "admin@example.com"
    password = "your-password"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$token = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://babyshield.cureviax.ai/api/v1/auth/login" `
    -Method POST `
    -Body $auth `
    -ContentType "application/json").access_token

# 2. Enable pg_trgm
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token" }
$result = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://babyshield.cureviax.ai/api/v1/admin/database/enable-pg-trgm" `
    -Method POST `
    -Headers $headers

$result
```

## Expected Response

### First Time (Extension Not Yet Enabled)

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "extension_status": "newly_enabled",
    "extension_version": "latest",
    "similarity_test": 1.0,
    "index_status": "created",
    "existing_indexes": [],
    "indexes_created": [
      "product_trgm",
      "brand_trgm",
      "description_trgm",
      "hazard_trgm"
    ],
    "message": "pg_trgm extension is now enabled and configured"
  }
}
```

### Subsequent Calls (Already Enabled)

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "extension_status": "already_enabled",
    "extension_version": "1.6",
    "similarity_test": 1.0,
    "index_status": "already_exist",
    "existing_indexes": [
      "idx_recalls_brand_trgm",
      "idx_recalls_description_trgm",
      "idx_recalls_hazard_trgm",
      "idx_recalls_product_trgm"
    ],
    "indexes_created": [],
    "message": "pg_trgm extension is now enabled and configured"
  }
}
```

## Verification

### 1. Check Extension is Enabled

```sql
SELECT extname, extversion 
FROM pg_extension 
WHERE extname = 'pg_trgm';
```

Expected result:
```
 extname | extversion 
---------+------------
 pg_trgm | 1.6
```

### 2. Test Similarity Function

```sql
SELECT similarity('baby', 'baby') as exact_match,
       similarity('baby', 'babe') as similar;
```

Expected result:
```
 exact_match | similar 
-------------+---------
         1.0 | 0.75
```

### 3. Verify Indexes Created

```sql
SELECT indexname, indexdef 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'recalls_enhanced' 
  AND indexname LIKE '%trgm%'
ORDER BY indexname;
```

Expected result:
```
        indexname         |                                      indexdef                                       
--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 idx_recalls_brand_trgm   | CREATE INDEX idx_recalls_brand_trgm ON recalls_enhanced USING gin (lower(brand) gin_trgm_ops)
 idx_recalls_description_trgm | CREATE INDEX idx_recalls_description_trgm ON recalls_enhanced USING gin (lower(description) gin_trgm_ops)
 idx_recalls_hazard_trgm  | CREATE INDEX idx_recalls_hazard_trgm ON recalls_enhanced USING gin (lower(hazard) gin_trgm_ops)
 idx_recalls_product_trgm | CREATE INDEX idx_recalls_product_trgm ON recalls_enhanced USING gin (lower(product_name) gin_trgm_ops)
```

### 4. Test Search Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST https://babyshield.cureviax.ai/api/v1/search/advanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"baby","limit":10}'
```

**Before pg_trgm enabled:**
```json
{
  "total": 0,
  "items": []
}
```

**After pg_trgm enabled:**
```json
{
  "total": 12483,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "product_name": "Baby Safety Gate",
      "brand": "Safety First",
      "hazard": "Fall hazard",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 5. Check CloudWatch Logs

The warning message should disappear:
```
❌ Before: "pg_trgm extension not enabled, falling back to LIKE search"
✅ After:  No warning message (search uses trigram similarity)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: 403 Forbidden

**Cause:** User doesn't have admin privileges

**Solution:**
1. Verify user has `is_admin`, `is_superuser`, or `role='admin'` in database
2. Check `User` table: `SELECT id, email, is_admin, role FROM users WHERE email='your-email';`
3. Grant admin privileges if needed: `UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE email='your-email';`

### Error: 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Token is invalid or expired

**Solution:**
1. Get a fresh token by logging in again
2. Check token expiration time
3. Verify you're using the correct credentials

### Error: 500 Internal Server Error

**Cause:** Database connection or permission issue

**Solution:**
1. Check application logs in CloudWatch
2. Verify database credentials in environment variables
3. Ensure application user has permission to create extensions
4. Check RDS parameter group allows extension creation

### Search Still Returns 0 Results

**Possible causes:**
1. Extension not yet propagated (wait 30 seconds and try again)
2. Indexes still building (check `pg_stat_progress_create_index`)
3. Application needs restart to reload schema
4. Different database being queried than where extension was enabled

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Check if extension is really enabled
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_trgm';

-- Check index creation progress
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;

-- Manually test search query
SELECT product_name, similarity('baby', lower(product_name)) as score
FROM recalls_enhanced
WHERE similarity('baby', lower(product_name)) > 0.3
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Technical Details

### Why pg_trgm?

The `pg_trgm` extension provides:

1. **Trigram Matching**: Breaks text into 3-character sequences for fuzzy matching
   - "baby" → "  b", " ba", "aby", "by "
   - Similarity score based on shared trigrams

2. **GIN Indexes**: Generalized Inverted Indexes for fast trigram lookup
   - Much faster than LIKE '%pattern%' (which can't use regular indexes)
   - Supports similarity threshold searches
   - Enables fuzzy matching at scale (137k+ records)

3. **Similarity Function**: `similarity(text1, text2)` returns float 0.0-1.0
   - 1.0 = identical strings
   - 0.75+ = very similar
   - 0.3+ = somewhat similar (typical search threshold)

### Database Permissions Required

The application user (`babyshield_user`) needs:
- ✅ `CREATE EXTENSION` privilege on database
- ✅ `CREATE INDEX` privilege on `recalls_enhanced` table
- ✅ Connection to `postgres` database (for extension creation)

These should already be granted for standard RDS setups.

### Performance Impact

**Before (LIKE search):**
- Query time: 2-5 seconds for 137k records
- Full table scan required
- No index can be used
- CPU-intensive string matching

**After (pg_trgm with GIN indexes):**
- Query time: 50-200ms for 137k records
- Index scan only
- Parallel-safe
- Minimal CPU usage

**Index sizes:**
- Each GIN index: ~50-100MB (depends on data)
- Total: ~200-400MB for 4 indexes
- Storage is cheap, fast search is valuable
