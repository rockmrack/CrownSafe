---

### Step 2: Find the Service Account

Look for this service account in the list:

```
firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@babyshield-8f552.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**It will look like:**
```
Name: firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc
Email: firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@babyshield-8f552.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

---

### Step 3: Click on the Service Account

Click anywhere on that row to open the service account details.

---

### Step 4: Go to the "KEYS" Tab

At the top of the page, you'll see tabs:
- DETAILS
- PERMISSIONS
- **KEYS** ‚Üê Click this one

---

### Step 5: Find the Exposed Key

In the Keys section, look for a key with ID starting with:

```
f9d6fbee209506ae0c7d96f3c93ce233048013f6
```

**Key details:**
- Type: JSON
- Created: (some date in the past)

## ‚ùå WHAT IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE KEY?
