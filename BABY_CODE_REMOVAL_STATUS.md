# Crown Safe Baby Code Removal - Status Report

## Date: October 24, 2025

## Objective
Remove all baby product recall-related code from the Crown Safe repository to prepare for pure hair product safety focus.

## Current Status: BLOCKED

### ✅ Completed
1. **Deep Scan Performed**
   - Identified 100+ references to baby/recall code using grep
   - Found 38 recall-related files
   - Found 6 baby-related files
   - Created comprehensive inventory of all files to remove

2. **Server Successfully Running**
   - FastAPI server started on port 8001
   - Crown Safe endpoints registered at `/api/v1/crown-safe/barcode`
   - Server is functioning despite baby code still present

3. **Crown Safe Migration Created**
   - Migration file: `db/migrations/versions/2025_10_24_add_crown_safe_models.py`
   - Includes all 8 Crown Safe tables (hair_profiles, ingredients, products, etc.)
   - Migration is properly formatted and ready to execute

4. **Seed Script Ready**
   - `scripts/seed_crown_safe_data.py` contains 50+ ingredients and 13 hair products
   - Script is ready to populate database after migration runs

### ⛔ Blocked
**File Deletion Impossible - Access Denied Errors**

Attempted deletion of 5 API endpoint files:
- `api/recall_detail_endpoints.py`
- `api/recall_alert_system.py` 
- `api/recalls_endpoints.py`
- `api/baby_features_endpoints.py`
- `api/premium_features_endpoints.py`

All deletions failed with "Access to the path is denied" errors.

**Root Cause**: Files are locked by either:
1. VS Code editor (files open in tabs)
2. Running FastAPI server (Python process has files imported)
3. Windows file system lock

Attempted workarounds also failed:
- `Remove-Item -Force` → Access denied
- `Rename-Item -Force` → Access denied  
- Cannot overwrite or modify locked files

## Code to Disable in api/main_babyshield.py

### Section 1: Lines 1269-1287 (Recall Alert & Search Systems)
Currently ACTIVE and importing baby recall code.

Need to comment out:
```python
# Include Recall Alert System
try:
    from api.recall_alert_system import recall_alert_router
    app.include_router(recall_alert_router)
    logging.info("✓ Recall Alert System registered")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Failed to register recall alert system: {e}")

# Include Recall Search System
try:
    from api.recalls_endpoints import router as recalls_router
    app.include_router(recalls_router)
    logging.info("✓ Recall Search System registered")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Failed to register recall search system: {e}")
```

### Section 2: Lines 1533-1541 (Recall Detail Endpoints)
Currently ACTIVE and importing baby recall code.

Need to comment out:
```python
# Include recall detail endpoints
try:
    from api.recall_detail_endpoints import router as recall_detail_router
    app.include_router(recall_detail_router)
    logging.info("✓ Recall detail endpoints registered")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Failed to register recall detail endpoints: {e}")
```

### Section 3: Lines 1639-1660 (Premium & Baby Features)
Currently WRAPPED in try-except (partially handled) but still needs commenting.

Need to comment out:
```python
try:
    from api.premium_features_endpoints import router as premium_router
    app.include_router(premium_router)
    logging.info("Premium Features endpoints registered")
except ImportError as e:
    logging.warning(f"Premium features (baby allergy checking) not available: {e}")

try:
    from api.baby_features_endpoints import router as baby_router
    app.include_router(baby_router)
    logging.info("✓ Baby Safety Features endpoints registered")
except (ImportError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
    logging.warning(f"Baby Safety Features not available: {e}")
```

## Code to Remove from core_infra/database.py

### Lines 113-148: RecallDB Models
Remove these entire classes:
- `LegacyRecallDB`
- `EnhancedRecallDB`

These are marked with comments:
```python
# LEGACY BABY CODE: TO BE REMOVED FOR CROWN SAFE
# These recall tables are not needed for hair product safety
```

### Lines 177-220: Commented FamilyMember/Allergy Models
Delete these commented-out sections entirely:
- `# class FamilyMember(Base):`
- `# class Allergy(Base):`

These are already commented out, just need complete removal.

### Lines 477-521: Commented Helper Functions
Delete these commented-out sections entirely:
- `# def get_user_family_members(...)`
- `# def get_family_member_allergies(...)`
- `# def get_user_allergies(...)`
- `# def add_family_member_allergy(...)`
- `# def add_user_allergy(...)`

These are already commented out, just need complete removal.

## Next Steps (When Files Can Be Unlocked)

### Step 1: Close Files and Stop Server
```powershell
# In VS Code: Close all api/*.py files
# Stop the FastAPI server (Ctrl+C in terminal or close terminal)
```

### Step 2: Delete API Endpoint Files
```powershell
Remove-Item api\recall_detail_endpoints.py -Force
Remove-Item api\recall_alert_system.py -Force
Remove-Item api\recalls_endpoints.py -Force
Remove-Item api\baby_features_endpoints.py -Force
Remove-Item api\premium_features_endpoints.py -Force
```

### Step 3: Delete Script Files
```powershell
Remove-Item scripts\ingest_recalls.py -Force
Remove-Item scripts\seed_recall_db.py -Force
Remove-Item scripts\test_recall*.py -Force
Remove-Item scripts\test_baby*.py -Force
```

### Step 4: Delete Root Scripts
```powershell
Remove-Item verify_production_recalls.py -Force
Remove-Item test_recall*.py -Force
Remove-Item find_recalls.py -Force
Remove-Item check_recalls.py -Force
Remove-Item check_uk_recalls_azure.py -Force
```

### Step 5: Delete Worker Files
```powershell
Remove-Item workers\recall_tasks.py -Force
```

### Step 6: Delete Database Model Files
```powershell
Remove-Item core_infra\enhanced_database_schema.py -Force
Remove-Item db\data_models\recall.py -Force
```

### Step 7: Clean core_infra/database.py
Manually edit to remove:
- Lines 113-148 (RecallDB models)
- Lines 177-220 (commented FamilyMember/Allergy)
- Lines 477-521 (commented helper functions)

### Step 8: Clean api/main_babyshield.py
Manually comment out the three import sections listed above.

### Step 9: Run Database Migration
```powershell
cd db
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

Expected output: Crown Safe tables created (hair_profiles, ingredients, hair_products, etc.)

### Step 10: Seed Database
```powershell
python scripts\seed_crown_safe_data.py
```

Expected output: 50+ ingredients and 13 hair products inserted.

### Step 11: Start Clean Server
```powershell
python -m uvicorn api.main_babyshield:app --reload --port 8001
```

### Step 12: Test Crown Safe Endpoints
```powershell
# Visit http://localhost:8001/docs
# Verify only Crown Safe endpoints are visible
# Test POST /api/v1/crown-safe/barcode endpoint
```

### Step 13: Verify No Broken Imports
```powershell
python -c "from api import main_babyshield; print('✓ All imports working')"
```

## Manual Cleanup Required

Due to file locks, the following must be done manually:
1. Close all `api/*.py` files in VS Code
2. Stop the running FastAPI server
3. Run the cleanup commands in Step 2-6 above
4. Edit `core_infra/database.py` to remove recall models
5. Edit `api/main_babyshield.py` to comment out baby/recall imports

## Summary

**Files to Delete**: 38+ recall files + 6+ baby files = 44+ total files  
**Code Sections to Modify**: 2 files (main_babyshield.py, database.py)  
**Migration to Run**: 1 file (2025_10_24_add_crown_safe_models.py)  
**Seed Script to Run**: 1 file (seed_crown_safe_data.py)

**Current Blocker**: File locks preventing deletion - requires manual intervention to close files/stop server.

**Estimated Time After Unblock**: 15-20 minutes to complete all cleanup and testing.
