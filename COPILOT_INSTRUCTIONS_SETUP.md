## Key Features

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major aspects of the repository documented  
✅ **Code Examples**: 23 balanced code blocks with Python and Bash examples  
✅ **Security-Focused**: Emphasizes security best practices and common pitfalls  
✅ **Learned from Audits**: Incorporates lessons from previous Copilot audits  
✅ **Practical**: Includes quick reference section for common tasks  
✅ **Maintainable**: Clear structure with section headings for easy updates

## Verification

Created and ran a comprehensive test script that verified:
- File exists at correct location (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- Contains all required sections (11 major sections)
- Mentions key technologies (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, pytest, AWS)
- Includes code examples (Python and Bash)
- Documents common patterns (FastAPI endpoints, error handling, database models)
- Provides security guidance (Never Commit, Always Do, Authentication)
- Has balanced code blocks (46 backticks = 23 complete blocks)

All 24 test checks passed ✅

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Suggestions**: Copilot will understand project context and patterns
2. **Consistent Style**: Enforces coding standards across contributions
3. **Faster Onboarding**: New developers get immediate context
4. **Fewer Mistakes**: Documents common pitfalls and gotchas
5. **Security-First**: Emphasizes security considerations upfront
6. **Efficient Development**: Quick reference for common commands

## Maintenance

The instructions should be updated when:
- Major dependencies are upgraded
- New architectural patterns are introduced
- Security guidelines change
- CI/CD workflows are modified
- New common pitfalls are discovered

Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of the file when making changes.
