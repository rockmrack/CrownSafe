# Visual Recognition Fix - Image URL Support

**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Issue:** `/api/v1/safety-check` with `image_url` returns 500 error  
**Status:** FIXED with workaround  

---

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause:
The optimized workflow's planner fails when processing `image_url` requests, causing a 500 error before reaching the fallback logic.

### Why It Failed:
1. `run_optimized_safety_check()` calls `planner.process_task()`
2. Planner doesn't properly handle image_url
3. Exception occurs in planner
4. Error bubbles up as 500 before reaching our null checks

---

## Solution Implemented

### Workaround Strategy:
Route image_url requests DIRECTLY to the visual search agent, bypassing the problematic planner.

### Code Changes (api/main_babyshield.py):

```python
# BEFORE calling optimized workflow:
if req.image_url and not req.barcode and not req.model_number and not req.product_name:
    # Route directly to visual search agent
    visual_result = await visual_search_agent.identify_product_from_image(req.image_url)
    # Return formatted response
    return JSONResponse(status_code=200, content={...})
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ `/api/v1/safety-check` with image_url → 500 error
- ✅ `/api/v1/visual/search` → Works

### After Fix:
- ✅ `/api/v1/safety-check` with image_url → Routes to visual agent
- ✅ `/api/v1/visual/search` → Still works

## Deployment

**Image:** `production-20251006-v3`  
**Commit:** `a7a7480`  
**Branch:** `main`

## Verification Steps

1. Test image_url via safety-check:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://babyshield.cureviax.ai/api/v1/safety-check" `
  -Method Post `
  -Body '{"user_id":1,"image_url":"https://picsum.photos/200"}' `
  -ContentType "application/json"
```

Expected: Status 200, visual analysis results

2. Verify visual search still works:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://babyshield.cureviax.ai/api/v1/visual/search" `
  -Method Post `
  -Body '{"image_url":"https://picsum.photos/200"}' `
  -ContentType "application/json"
```

Expected: Status 200, product suggestions

---

## Impact

- ✅ Image recognition now works via safety-check endpoint
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Performance: Same as direct visual search

---

## Future Improvements

1. Fix the planner to properly handle image_url
2. Remove workaround once planner is fixed
3. Add integration tests for image_url path

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
