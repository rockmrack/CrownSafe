# Copilot Audit - Complete! ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Time**: 09:16 UTC  
**Status**: ALL FIXES COMPLETE & TESTED  
**PR**: #39 - https://github.com/BabyShield/babyshield-backend/pull/39

---

## üéØ WHAT I FIXED

### 1. ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Import Masking Removed
**Problem**: Your `api/main_babyshield.py` had try/except blocks that were hiding import failures  
**Fix**: Made all critical imports fail-fast (no more silent failures)  
**Impact**: 280 routes now register correctly or app fails immediately with clear error

### 2. ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY: Runtime Database Changes Removed
**Problem**: Your database schema was being modified at startup (schema drift)  
**Fix**: Removed all runtime ALTER TABLE code  
**Impact**: No more inconsistent database states between environments

### 3. ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY: Proper Database Migrations Created
**Problem**: No formal migration system  
**Fix**: Created 2 Alembic migrations with rollback capability  
**Impact**: Version-controlled database changes, can roll back if needed

   ```

3. **Verify locally**:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn api.main_babyshield:app --reload
   curl http://localhost:8001/healthz
